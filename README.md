# neil

`neil` is a clojure script powered by babashka that initializes a Clojure project structure with
defaults that I like to use.

## Installation

1. Put the babashka project somewhere in your path
1. Add neil script somewhere on your path

   ```sh
   neil <project-name>
   ```

This is a toy project with my preferred defaults. If you are looking for a project that is more
configurable or professional grade, one of these projects may be a better bet
